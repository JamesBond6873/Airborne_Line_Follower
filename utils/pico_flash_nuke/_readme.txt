
press the white button on the pico and plug to the USB

drag and drop "flash_nuke.uf2" into the windows drive created by the plugged pico

the pico closes the drive window and autoreboots

the drive likely reappers

run the Arduino GUI

the Arduino GUI likely will not show the right pico serial port but
	given the instruction it is a pico (and clicking "show all ports"?)
	it will then find the pico associated to a Windows drive
	will put code into the pico making a serial port
	finally will show the right serial port for the pico
