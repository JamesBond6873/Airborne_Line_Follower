
FPG Airborne line follow:
- main params (blackThreshold, normalSpeed, KP, KD, KI, ...)
- save in a circular array (struct or class?): time, sensors, nBlack, err, motor speeds
- calc new state (state change) based on flags (wallNear, laneLostTime, ...)
- motion control modes 0=Stop, 1=LineFollow, 2=GoBackToLine, 3=WithinWalls, ...
- active functions DetectColors, BeepOnColor, WaitOnColor, ...
- log sensor readings along the path
- dataLogger, work all the time (restart upon crash?) but change filename upon a large pause on data
- how to get flags into the pi pico? sd card would be great... R-pi would be the best...
