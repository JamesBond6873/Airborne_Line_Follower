
FPG Airborne line follow R-Pi-Pico:
- main params (blackThreshold, normalSpeed, KP, KD, KI, ...)
- save in a circular array (struct or class?): time, sensors, nBlack, err, motor speeds
- calc new state (state change) based on flags (wallNear, laneLostTime, ...)
- switch on loopMode

- loopMode:  m0_Stop, m1_Calib, m2_LineFollow, m3_GoBackToLine, m4_WithinWalls, m5_ExploreToFindLine...
- globalFlags / active functions:  detectColorsFlag, beepOnColorFlag, waitOnColorFlag, ...
- private vars: workingLevel (only setWorkingLevel(n) can change it)

- log sensor readings all along the path

Raspberry Pi3:
- dataLogger, work all the time (restart upon crash?) but change filename upon a large pause on data
- how to get flags into the pi pico? sd card would be great, but R-pi3 can use USB to send cmds.
- need to make a protocol "I say over, then you can speak, you say over, then I can speak. You start."
